# LSC-for-fivem
this is my first building that i ever created.

it works on gta v and fivem

I made this building with the underlying thoughts for role play, you can use it in your rp server as the main office of the roadside assistance.





----------------------- Installation [MAPPING] FIVEM : -----------------------
A- Open the file with 7zip, Winrar or any other program that allows you to unzip these types of files
B- Unzip the file into your MAP FOLDER who start on your server.cfg
C- For FiveM servers - Drop all my file on my zip to the Stream
folder that should be located in your Map folder, and that folder shall need to be up on
your server Resources folder. After you have that ready, you will need to start the script on your Server.cfg
(The name of the script will be the name folder when you have put the maps on... For example : start mapping if your
folder name is "mapping")




----------------------- Installation SINGLEPLAYER : -----------------------
A - Extract the YMAP from the folder and set it on your desktop
B - Open OpenIV, install it if you dont have it already
